# UPI-DeepLinked
Example of Deeplinking UPI in android application to accept the payment without any payment gateway.
Till now i tried in many UPI Apps like BHIM, TEZ, Phonepe, PAYTM and many others and worked on almost all apps.
I have also coded for whether the payment is successful or not, but only BHIM and TEZ seems to be sending the data back to app that tells whether the transaction was success or not.
Got data null in other applications.
